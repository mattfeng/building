  defn: used for text on the PCB
- term: surface-mount parts
- term: reflow soldering
  defn: the process in which a solder paste (sticky mixture of powdered solder and flux) is used to temporarily attach electrical components to their contact pads, after which the entire assembly is heated. The paste _reflows_ into a molten state, eventually forming permanent solder joints.
