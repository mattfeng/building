## conventional vs. climb milling

- **conventional**. feed direction opposes direction of cutting edge of mill; if the mill is turning clockwise and the cutting edge is on the left, the feed direction will be coming towards the user.
  - the force of the cutter pushes the leadscrew against the nut (the load is in the correct direction)
