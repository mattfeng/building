- **feed screw.** a screw that imparts feed motion in a machine tool.
- **feeler gauge.** a gauge consisting of a number of thin blades of calibrated thickness used for measuring narrow gaps or clearances.

- [**lapping.**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapping) A machining process in which two surfaces are rubbed together with an abrasive between them. It is used to produce a desired surface roughness, as well as accurate surfaces. For example, lapping is commonly used in lens making to machine the correct curvature and lens clarity.
- **leadscrew.** A screw used as a linkage in a machine, to translate turning motion into linear motion. Also known as a **power screw**, **translation screw**.
- **linkage.** Any assembly of systems connected to manage forces and movement.

## M
- **Mastercam.** A suite of CAM and CAD/CAM software tools, often used to generate G-code for mills.

## P
- [**parallels.**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallels_(engineering)) Rectangular blocks of metal that help keep work parallel and raised evenly in a vise during milling. Malleting the stock (often below the workpiece) from above will create friction that prevents the parallels from shifting. Parallels are commonly made from tool steel, stainless steel, or cast iron.

- **Stereolithography (SLA) 3D printing.** A 3D printing technique in which thin films of resin are selectively cured with light to build a 3D structure.
  - SLA printing has favorable properties such as isotropy (as opposed to anisotropy in FDM), watertightness, and smooth surface finish.
  - It is best for functional prototyping, patterns, molds, and tooling.
