- **Stereolithography (SLA) 3D printing.** A 3D printing technique in which thin films of resin are selectively cured with light to build a 3D structure.
  - SLA printing has favorable properties such as isotropy (as opposed to anisotropy in FDM), watertightness, and smooth surface finish.
  - It is best for functional prototyping, patterns, molds, and tooling.
